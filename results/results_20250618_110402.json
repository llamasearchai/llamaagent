    "technique": "SPRE",
    "task": "Excellent. I will now proceed with the complete master coding prompt and scientific implementation plan for the first and most foundational feature we designed: Strategic Planning & Resourceful Execution (SPRE).\n\nThis prompt is engineered to be a comprehensive, production-ready directive. It integrates the core concepts from the \"Pre-Act\" paper (for multi-step planning) and the \"SEM\" paper (for resource-efficient tool use), providing a clear path from theory to implementation within the LlamaAgent framework.\n\nMaster Coding Prompt: Implementing Strategic Planning & Resourceful Execution (SPRE)\n\nObjective:\nIntegrate a two-tiered reasoning framework, SPRE, into the LlamaAgent core to fundamentally enhance its decision-making capabilities. The primary goal is to evolve the agent from a purely reactive system to a strategic planner that not only formulates a multi-step plan to solve a task but also judiciously assesses the necessity of each tool-based action to conserve resources. This will be accomplished by introducing an explicit \"Planning Phase\" before the execution loop and embedding a \"Resource Assessment\" check within the loop, directly inspired by the methodologies outlined in the Pre-Act and SEM research papers.\n\n1. SPRE Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe existing ReactAgent execution flow will be modified to follow this new, more sophisticated SPRE cycle:\n\nTask Ingestion: The agent receives the user's prompt.\n\nPlanning Phase (Pre-Act Inspired):\n\nA specialized Planner agent is invoked.\n\nIt receives the user's full task description.\n\nIt generates and outputs a structured, multi-step execution plan as a list of PlanStep objects. Each step will contain a description and required_information.\n\nIterative Execution Loop: The agent iterates through the PlanStep objects. For each step:\n\nResource Assessment (SEM Inspired): The agent first performs an internal \"necessity check.\" It asks itself: \"Given my current context, history, and internal knowledge, is invoking an external tool strictly necessary to acquire the required_information for this step?\"\n\nDecision Fork:\n\nIf Tool is Necessary: The agent proceeds with the standard ReAct tool invocation (Thought -> Action -> Observation).\n\nIf Tool is NOT Necessary: The agent skips the tool call and instead generates a Thought that explains how it can fulfill the step using its existing knowledge. It then proceeds to the next plan step.\n\nSynthesis and Final Answer: After completing all plan steps (or determining it can conclude early), a Synthesizer agent aggregates all observations and internal reasoning steps to produce the final, comprehensive answer.\n\n2. Component-Level Implementation Plan:\n\nFile Modifications:\n\nPrimary modifications will occur in src/llamaagent/agents/react.py.\n\nSupporting data classes will be added in src/llamaagent/agents/base.py.\n\nCLI flag integration in src/llamaagent/cli/main.py.\n\nNew Data Structures (src/llamaagent/agents/base.py):\n\nCreate a PlanStep Pydantic model:\n\nGenerated python\nclass PlanStep(BaseModel):\n    step_id: int\n    description: str\n    required_information: str\n    expected_outcome: str\n    is_completed: bool = False\n\n\nCreate a ExecutionPlan Pydantic model:\n\nGenerated python\nclass ExecutionPlan(BaseModel):\n    original_task: str\n    steps: List[PlanStep]\n    current_step: int = 0\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\ncontent_copy\ndownload\nUse code with caution.\nPython\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\n\nModify AgentResponse to optionally include the ExecutionPlan.\n\nAgent Role and Prompt Engineering:\n\nPlanner Agent: Define a new AgentRole enum value, PLANNER. The system prompt for this agent must be:\n\n\"You are a master strategist and planner. Your task is to receive a complex user request and decompose it into a structured, sequential list of logical steps. For each step, clearly define the action to be taken and what specific information is required to complete it. Output this plan as a JSON object adhering to the ExecutionPlan schema. Do not attempt to solve the task, only plan it.\"\n\nResource Assessment Prompt: During the execution loop, the agent will use a sub-prompt for the necessity check:\n\n\"Current Plan Step: '{step.description}'. Information Needed: '{step.required_information}'. Reviewing the conversation history and my internal knowledge, is it absolutely necessary to use an external tool to acquire this information? Answer with only 'true' or 'false' followed by a brief justification.\"\n\nModification of ReactAgent.execute:\n\nThe method will first check if spree_mode is enabled.\n\nIf true, it will first call the PLANNER to generate the ExecutionPlan.\n\nThe main for loop will now iterate through plan.steps instead of range(self.config.max_iterations).\n\nInside the loop, it will perform the Resource Assessment step. The agent's decision to use a tool will be based on the boolean output of this self-correction step.\n\n3. Scientific Testing and Validation Protocol:\n\nThe primary hypothesis is that the SPRE-enabled agent will achieve a task success rate comparable to or higher than a pure Pre-Act agent, while significantly reducing the number of external tool calls and thus improving efficiency.\n\nBenchmark: Utilize the GAIA benchmark from the WebDancer paper (arXiv:2505.22648v1), focusing on a subset of tasks that require 3+ steps of information retrieval and reasoning.\n\nBaselines for Rigorous Comparison:\n\nVanilla ReAct: The standard LlamaAgent implementation.\n\nPre-Act Only: A modified agent that generates a plan but executes a tool for every step without resource assessment.\n\nSEM Only: A reactive agent without a plan that performs a resource assessment check before every potential tool use.\n\nSPRE Agent: The fully implemented new feature.\n\nMetrics to Collect:\n\nTask Success Rate (%): The primary measure of effectiveness.\n\nAverage Tool-API Calls per Task: The primary measure of efficiency.\n\nAverage Latency per Task (s): To measure overall task completion time.\n\nAverage Reasoning Tokens per Task: To measure cognitive overhead.\n\nResults Presentation: The findings will be presented in a clear summary table. The expected outcome is for the SPRE Agent row to show the highest (Success Rate / API Calls) ratio, scientifically demonstrating its superior strategic efficiency.\n\nAgent Configuration\tTask Success Rate (%)\tAvg. API Calls\tAvg. Latency (s)\nVanilla ReAct\t(result)\t(result)\t(result)\nPre-Act Only\t(result)\t(result)\t(result)\nSEM Only\t(result)\t(result)\t(result)\nSPRE Agent (Ours)\t(expected best)\t(expected lowest)\t(result)\n\n4. Documentation and CLI Integration:\n\nCLI Flag: Add a --spree flag to the llamaagent interactive and llamaagent chat commands. When this flag is present, the system should instantiate and use the SPRE-enabled agent logic.\n\nDocumentation:\n\nUpdate README.md to list \"Strategic Planning & Resourceful Execution (SPRE)\" as a key feature.\n\nAdd a new section under \"Advanced Usage\" explaining the SPRE methodology and how to use the --spree flag.\n\nExample Script: Create a new example file, examples/spree_usage.py, that demonstrates how to programmatically invoke the SPRE agent on a complex task, print the generated plan, and show the step-by-step execution including the resource assessment decisions.\n\n",

I will now proceed with the complete master coding prompt and scientific implementation plan for the second proposed feature: Generative Debate Tree for Data Augmentation (GDT-DA).\n\nThis prompt builds on the scientific foundation of the MASTER and MCTS-SQL papers, outlining a comprehensive methodology for creating a novel and powerful data generation pipeline within the LlamaAgent framework.\n\nMaster Coding Prompt: Implementing Generative Debate Tree for Data Augmentation (GDT-DA)\n\nObjective:\nArchitect a novel, automated data generation framework, GDT-DA, designed to produce a superior corpus of training data for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. This framework will leverage a multi-agent system to simulate a structured, exploratory debate around a given problem, generating rich, multi-perspective reasoning traces. Inspired by the \"simulated teaching\" in the MASTER paper and the exploratory search from MCTS-SQL, the goal is to create a dataset that teaches models not just what the right answer is, but how to reason towards it by exploring arguments, identifying flaws, and synthesizing information, thereby producing models with demonstrably stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks.\n\n1. GDT-DA Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe GDT-DA pipeline will be an offline process that takes a dataset of problems (e.g., math questions) and outputs a new, augmented dataset of detailed reasoning traces. The process for each problem is as follows:\n\nProblem Initialization: A seed problem (e.g., a question from the GSM8K dataset) is used to initialize the root DebateNode of a new tree.\n\nTree Expansion - Multi-Agent Debate:\n\nArgument Generation (Expansion): For the current active node, multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer) are prompted in parallel to propose the next logical step, argument, or piece of evidence. Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path. This path, including the initial problem, all intermediate agent arguments, and the corresponding critiques, is concatenated into a single, structured conversational document. This document becomes one entry in the new fine-tuning dataset.\n\n2. Component-Level Implementation Plan:\n\nNew Directory Structure: This is a new, major capability.

Analyze the following proposal in the context of the overall problem. Assess its factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance. Assign a score from 0.0 to 1.0 and provide a justification. Identify any fallacies or errors.\"\n\n3. Scientific Testing and Validation Protocol:\n\nThe core hypothesis is that fine-tuning a model on the rich, debate-style traces from GDT-DA leads to superior reasoning performance compared to fine-tuning on standard question-answer pairs or simple CoT traces.\n\nBenchmark: The GSM8K dataset is ideal due to its focus on complex, multi-step mathematical reasoning.\n\nData Generation:\n\nUse the GDT-DA pipeline on the official GSM8K training split to generate a new, augmented training set: GSM8K-GDT.

The process for each problem is as follows:\n\nProblem Initialization: A seed problem (e.g., a question from the GSM8K dataset) is used to initialize the root DebateNode of a new tree.\n\nTree Expansion - Multi-Agent Debate:\n\nArgument Generation (Expansion): For the current active node, multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer) are prompted in parallel to propose the next logical step, argument, or piece of evidence. Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path. This path, including the initial problem, all intermediate agent arguments, and the corresponding critiques, is concatenated into a single, structured conversational document. This document becomes one entry in the new fine-tuning dataset.\n\n2. Component-Level Implementation Plan:\n\nNew Directory Structure: This is a new, major capability.

Scientific Testing and Validation Protocol:\n\nThe core hypothesis is that fine-tuning a model on the rich, debate-style traces from GDT-DA leads to superior reasoning performance compared to fine-tuning on standard question-answer pairs or simple CoT traces.\n\nBenchmark: The GSM8K dataset is ideal due to its focus on complex, multi-step mathematical reasoning.\n\nData Generation:\n\nUse the GDT-DA pipeline on the official GSM8K training split to generate a new, augmented training set: GSM8K-GDT.

This framework will leverage a multi-agent system to simulate a structured, exploratory debate around a given problem, generating rich, multi-perspective reasoning traces. Inspired by the \"simulated teaching\" in the MASTER paper and the exploratory search from MCTS-SQL, the goal is to create a dataset that teaches models not just what the right answer is, but how to reason towards it by exploring arguments, identifying flaws, and synthesizing information, thereby producing models with demonstrably stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks.\n\n1. GDT-DA Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe GDT-DA pipeline will be an offline process that takes a dataset of problems (e.g., math questions) and outputs a new, augmented dataset of detailed reasoning traces. The process for each problem is as follows:\n\nProblem Initialization: A seed problem (e.g., a question from the GSM8K dataset) is used to initialize the root DebateNode of a new tree.\n\nTree Expansion - Multi-Agent Debate:\n\nArgument Generation (Expansion): For the current active node, multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer) are prompted in parallel to propose the next logical step, argument, or piece of evidence. Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path.

This framework will leverage a multi-agent system to simulate a structured, exploratory debate around a given problem, generating rich, multi-perspective reasoning traces. Inspired by the \"simulated teaching\" in the MASTER paper and the exploratory search from MCTS-SQL, the goal is to create a dataset that teaches models not just what the right answer is, but how to reason towards it by exploring arguments, identifying flaws, and synthesizing information, thereby producing models with demonstrably stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks.\n\n1. GDT-DA Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe GDT-DA pipeline will be an offline process that takes a dataset of problems (e.g., math questions) and outputs a new, augmented dataset of detailed reasoning traces. The process for each problem is as follows:\n\nProblem Initialization: A seed problem (e.g., a question from the GSM8K dataset) is used to initialize the root DebateNode of a new tree.\n\nTree Expansion - Multi-Agent Debate:\n\nArgument Generation (Expansion): For the current active node, multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer) are prompted in parallel to propose the next logical step, argument, or piece of evidence. Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path.

    "technique": "SPRE",
    "task": "Excellent. I will now proceed with the complete master coding prompt and scientific implementation plan for the first and most foundational feature we designed: Strategic Planning & Resourceful Execution (SPRE).\n\nThis prompt is engineered to be a comprehensive, production-ready directive. It integrates the core concepts from the \"Pre-Act\" paper (for multi-step planning) and the \"SEM\" paper (for resource-efficient tool use), providing a clear path from theory to implementation within the LlamaAgent framework.\n\nMaster Coding Prompt: Implementing Strategic Planning & Resourceful Execution (SPRE)\n\nObjective:\nIntegrate a two-tiered reasoning framework, SPRE, into the LlamaAgent core to fundamentally enhance its decision-making capabilities. The primary goal is to evolve the agent from a purely reactive system to a strategic planner that not only formulates a multi-step plan to solve a task but also judiciously assesses the necessity of each tool-based action to conserve resources. This will be accomplished by introducing an explicit \"Planning Phase\" before the execution loop and embedding a \"Resource Assessment\" check within the loop, directly inspired by the methodologies outlined in the Pre-Act and SEM research papers.\n\n1. SPRE Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe existing ReactAgent execution flow will be modified to follow this new, more sophisticated SPRE cycle:\n\nTask Ingestion: The agent receives the user's prompt.\n\nPlanning Phase (Pre-Act Inspired):\n\nA specialized Planner agent is invoked.\n\nIt receives the user's full task description.\n\nIt generates and outputs a structured, multi-step execution plan as a list of PlanStep objects. Each step will contain a description and required_information.\n\nIterative Execution Loop: The agent iterates through the PlanStep objects. For each step:\n\nResource Assessment (SEM Inspired): The agent first performs an internal \"necessity check.\" It asks itself: \"Given my current context, history, and internal knowledge, is invoking an external tool strictly necessary to acquire the required_information for this step?\"\n\nDecision Fork:\n\nIf Tool is Necessary: The agent proceeds with the standard ReAct tool invocation (Thought -> Action -> Observation).\n\nIf Tool is NOT Necessary: The agent skips the tool call and instead generates a Thought that explains how it can fulfill the step using its existing knowledge. It then proceeds to the next plan step.\n\nSynthesis and Final Answer: After completing all plan steps (or determining it can conclude early), a Synthesizer agent aggregates all observations and internal reasoning steps to produce the final, comprehensive answer.\n\n2. Component-Level Implementation Plan:\n\nFile Modifications:\n\nPrimary modifications will occur in src/llamaagent/agents/react.py.\n\nSupporting data classes will be added in src/llamaagent/agents/base.py.\n\nCLI flag integration in src/llamaagent/cli/main.py.\n\nNew Data Structures (src/llamaagent/agents/base.py):\n\nCreate a PlanStep Pydantic model:\n\nGenerated python\nclass PlanStep(BaseModel):\n    step_id: int\n    description: str\n    required_information: str\n    expected_outcome: str\n    is_completed: bool = False\n\n\nCreate a ExecutionPlan Pydantic model:\n\nGenerated python\nclass ExecutionPlan(BaseModel):\n    original_task: str\n    steps: List[PlanStep]\n    current_step: int = 0\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\ncontent_copy\ndownload\nUse code with caution.\nPython\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\n\nModify AgentResponse to optionally include the ExecutionPlan.\n\nAgent Role and Prompt Engineering:\n\nPlanner Agent: Define a new AgentRole enum value, PLANNER. The system prompt for this agent must be:\n\n\"You are a master strategist and planner. Your task is to receive a complex user request and decompose it into a structured, sequential list of logical steps. For each step, clearly define the action to be taken and what specific information is required to complete it. Output this plan as a JSON object adhering to the ExecutionPlan schema. Do not attempt to solve the task, only plan it.\"\n\nResource Assessment Prompt: During the execution loop, the agent will use a sub-prompt for the necessity check:\n\n\"Current Plan Step: '{step.description}'. Information Needed: '{step.required_information}'. Reviewing the conversation history and my internal knowledge, is it absolutely necessary to use an external tool to acquire this information? Answer with only 'true' or 'false' followed by a brief justification.\"\n\nModification of ReactAgent.execute:\n\nThe method will first check if spree_mode is enabled.\n\nIf true, it will first call the PLANNER to generate the ExecutionPlan.\n\nThe main for loop will now iterate through plan.steps instead of range(self.config.max_iterations).\n\nInside the loop, it will perform the Resource Assessment step. The agent's decision to use a tool will be based on the boolean output of this self-correction step.\n\n3. Scientific Testing and Validation Protocol:\n\nThe primary hypothesis is that the SPRE-enabled agent will achieve a task success rate comparable to or higher than a pure Pre-Act agent, while significantly reducing the number of external tool calls and thus improving efficiency.\n\nBenchmark: Utilize the GAIA benchmark from the WebDancer paper (arXiv:2505.22648v1), focusing on a subset of tasks that require 3+ steps of information retrieval and reasoning.\n\nBaselines for Rigorous Comparison:\n\nVanilla ReAct: The standard LlamaAgent implementation.\n\nPre-Act Only: A modified agent that generates a plan but executes a tool for every step without resource assessment.\n\nSEM Only: A reactive agent without a plan that performs a resource assessment check before every potential tool use.\n\nSPRE Agent: The fully implemented new feature.\n\nMetrics to Collect:\n\nTask Success Rate (%): The primary measure of effectiveness.\n\nAverage Tool-API Calls per Task: The primary measure of efficiency.\n\nAverage Latency per Task (s): To measure overall task completion time.\n\nAverage Reasoning Tokens per Task: To measure cognitive overhead.\n\nResults Presentation: The findings will be presented in a clear summary table. The expected outcome is for the SPRE Agent row to show the highest (Success Rate / API Calls) ratio, scientifically demonstrating its superior strategic efficiency.\n\nAgent Configuration\tTask Success Rate (%)\tAvg. API Calls\tAvg.

Documentation and CLI Integration:\n\nCLI Flag: Add a --spree flag to the llamaagent interactive and llamaagent chat commands. When this flag is present, the system should instantiate and use the SPRE-enabled agent logic.\n\nDocumentation:\n\nUpdate README.md to list \"Strategic Planning & Resourceful Execution (SPRE)\" as a key feature.\n\nAdd a new section under \"Advanced Usage\" explaining the SPRE methodology and how to use the --spree flag.\n\nExample Script: Create a new example file, examples/spree_usage.py, that demonstrates how to programmatically invoke the SPRE agent on a complex task, print the generated plan, and show the step-by-step execution including the resource assessment decisions.\n\n",

I will now proceed with the complete master coding prompt and scientific implementation plan for the second proposed feature: Generative Debate Tree for Data Augmentation (GDT-DA).\n\nThis prompt builds on the scientific foundation of the MASTER and MCTS-SQL papers, outlining a comprehensive methodology for creating a novel and powerful data generation pipeline within the LlamaAgent framework.\n\nMaster Coding Prompt: Implementing Generative Debate Tree for Data Augmentation (GDT-DA)\n\nObjective:\nArchitect a novel, automated data generation framework, GDT-DA, designed to produce a superior corpus of training data for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. This framework will leverage a multi-agent system to simulate a structured, exploratory debate around a given problem, generating rich, multi-perspective reasoning traces. Inspired by the \"simulated teaching\" in the MASTER paper and the exploratory search from MCTS-SQL, the goal is to create a dataset that teaches models not just what the right answer is, but how to reason towards it by exploring arguments, identifying flaws, and synthesizing information, thereby producing models with demonstrably stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks.\n\n1. GDT-DA Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe GDT-DA pipeline will be an offline process that takes a dataset of problems (e.g., math questions) and outputs a new, augmented dataset of detailed reasoning traces. The process for each problem is as follows:\n\nProblem Initialization: A seed problem (e.g., a question from the GSM8K dataset) is used to initialize the root DebateNode of a new tree.\n\nTree Expansion - Multi-Agent Debate:\n\nArgument Generation (Expansion): For the current active node, multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer) are prompted in parallel to propose the next logical step, argument, or piece of evidence. Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path.

This framework will leverage a multi-agent system to simulate a structured, exploratory debate around a given problem, generating rich, multi-perspective reasoning traces. Inspired by the \"simulated teaching\" in the MASTER paper and the exploratory search from MCTS-SQL, the goal is to create a dataset that teaches models not just what the right answer is, but how to reason towards it by exploring arguments, identifying flaws, and synthesizing information, thereby producing models with demonstrably stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks.\n\n1. GDT-DA Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe GDT-DA pipeline will be an offline process that takes a dataset of problems (e.g., math questions) and outputs a new, augmented dataset of detailed reasoning traces. The process for each problem is as follows:\n\nProblem Initialization: A seed problem (e.g., a question from the GSM8K dataset) is used to initialize the root DebateNode of a new tree.\n\nTree Expansion - Multi-Agent Debate:\n\nArgument Generation (Expansion): For the current active node, multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer) are prompted in parallel to propose the next logical step, argument, or piece of evidence. Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path. This path, including the initial problem, all intermediate agent arguments, and the corresponding critiques, is concatenated into a single, structured conversational document.

This framework will leverage a multi-agent system to simulate a structured, exploratory debate around a given problem, generating rich, multi-perspective reasoning traces. Inspired by the \"simulated teaching\" in the MASTER paper and the exploratory search from MCTS-SQL, the goal is to create a dataset that teaches models not just what the right answer is, but how to reason towards it by exploring arguments, identifying flaws, and synthesizing information, thereby producing models with demonstrably stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks.\n\n1. GDT-DA Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe GDT-DA pipeline will be an offline process that takes a dataset of problems (e.g., math questions) and outputs a new, augmented dataset of detailed reasoning traces. The process for each problem is as follows:\n\nProblem Initialization: A seed problem (e.g., a question from the GSM8K dataset) is used to initialize the root DebateNode of a new tree.\n\nTree Expansion - Multi-Agent Debate:\n\nArgument Generation (Expansion): For the current active node, multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer) are prompted in parallel to propose the next logical step, argument, or piece of evidence. Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path. This path, including the initial problem, all intermediate agent arguments, and the corresponding critiques, is concatenated into a single, structured conversational document.

This framework will leverage a multi-agent system to simulate a structured, exploratory debate around a given problem, generating rich, multi-perspective reasoning traces. Inspired by the \"simulated teaching\" in the MASTER paper and the exploratory search from MCTS-SQL, the goal is to create a dataset that teaches models not just what the right answer is, but how to reason towards it by exploring arguments, identifying flaws, and synthesizing information, thereby producing models with demonstrably stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks.\n\n1. GDT-DA Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe GDT-DA pipeline will be an offline process that takes a dataset of problems (e.g., math questions) and outputs a new, augmented dataset of detailed reasoning traces. The process for each problem is as follows:\n\nProblem Initialization: A seed problem (e.g., a question from the GSM8K dataset) is used to initialize the root DebateNode of a new tree.\n\nTree Expansion - Multi-Agent Debate:\n\nArgument Generation (Expansion): For the current active node, multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer) are prompted in parallel to propose the next logical step, argument, or piece of evidence. Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path.

This framework will leverage a multi-agent system to simulate a structured, exploratory debate around a given problem, generating rich, multi-perspective reasoning traces. Inspired by the \"simulated teaching\" in the MASTER paper and the exploratory search from MCTS-SQL, the goal is to create a dataset that teaches models not just what the right answer is, but how to reason towards it by exploring arguments, identifying flaws, and synthesizing information, thereby producing models with demonstrably stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks.\n\n1. GDT-DA Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe GDT-DA pipeline will be an offline process that takes a dataset of problems (e.g., math questions) and outputs a new, augmented dataset of detailed reasoning traces. The process for each problem is as follows:\n\nProblem Initialization: A seed problem (e.g., a question from the GSM8K dataset) is used to initialize the root DebateNode of a new tree.\n\nTree Expansion - Multi-Agent Debate:\n\nArgument Generation (Expansion): For the current active node, multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer) are prompted in parallel to propose the next logical step, argument, or piece of evidence. Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path.

This framework will leverage a multi-agent system to simulate a structured, exploratory debate around a given problem, generating rich, multi-perspective reasoning traces. Inspired by the \"simulated teaching\" in the MASTER paper and the exploratory search from MCTS-SQL, the goal is to create a dataset that teaches models not just what the right answer is, but how to reason towards it by exploring arguments, identifying flaws, and synthesizing information, thereby producing models with demonstrably stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks.\n\n1. GDT-DA Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe GDT-DA pipeline will be an offline process that takes a dataset of problems (e.g., math questions) and outputs a new, augmented dataset of detailed reasoning traces. The process for each problem is as follows:\n\nProblem Initialization: A seed problem (e.g., a question from the GSM8K dataset) is used to initialize the root DebateNode of a new tree.\n\nTree Expansion - Multi-Agent Debate:\n\nArgument Generation (Expansion): For the current active node, multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer) are prompted in parallel to propose the next logical step, argument, or piece of evidence. Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path.

    "technique": "SPRE",
    "task": "Excellent. I will now proceed with the complete master coding prompt and scientific implementation plan for the first and most foundational feature we designed: Strategic Planning & Resourceful Execution (SPRE).\n\nThis prompt is engineered to be a comprehensive, production-ready directive. It integrates the core concepts from the \"Pre-Act\" paper (for multi-step planning) and the \"SEM\" paper (for resource-efficient tool use), providing a clear path from theory to implementation within the LlamaAgent framework.\n\nMaster Coding Prompt: Implementing Strategic Planning & Resourceful Execution (SPRE)\n\nObjective:\nIntegrate a two-tiered reasoning framework, SPRE, into the LlamaAgent core to fundamentally enhance its decision-making capabilities. The primary goal is to evolve the agent from a purely reactive system to a strategic planner that not only formulates a multi-step plan to solve a task but also judiciously assesses the necessity of each tool-based action to conserve resources. This will be accomplished by introducing an explicit \"Planning Phase\" before the execution loop and embedding a \"Resource Assessment\" check within the loop, directly inspired by the methodologies outlined in the Pre-Act and SEM research papers.\n\n1. SPRE Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe existing ReactAgent execution flow will be modified to follow this new, more sophisticated SPRE cycle:\n\nTask Ingestion: The agent receives the user's prompt.\n\nPlanning Phase (Pre-Act Inspired):\n\nA specialized Planner agent is invoked.\n\nIt receives the user's full task description.\n\nIt generates and outputs a structured, multi-step execution plan as a list of PlanStep objects. Each step will contain a description and required_information.\n\nIterative Execution Loop: The agent iterates through the PlanStep objects. For each step:\n\nResource Assessment (SEM Inspired): The agent first performs an internal \"necessity check.\" It asks itself: \"Given my current context, history, and internal knowledge, is invoking an external tool strictly necessary to acquire the required_information for this step?\"\n\nDecision Fork:\n\nIf Tool is Necessary: The agent proceeds with the standard ReAct tool invocation (Thought -> Action -> Observation).\n\nIf Tool is NOT Necessary: The agent skips the tool call and instead generates a Thought that explains how it can fulfill the step using its existing knowledge. It then proceeds to the next plan step.\n\nSynthesis and Final Answer: After completing all plan steps (or determining it can conclude early), a Synthesizer agent aggregates all observations and internal reasoning steps to produce the final, comprehensive answer.\n\n2. Component-Level Implementation Plan:\n\nFile Modifications:\n\nPrimary modifications will occur in src/llamaagent/agents/react.py.\n\nSupporting data classes will be added in src/llamaagent/agents/base.py.\n\nCLI flag integration in src/llamaagent/cli/main.py.\n\nNew Data Structures (src/llamaagent/agents/base.py):\n\nCreate a PlanStep Pydantic model:\n\nGenerated python\nclass PlanStep(BaseModel):\n    step_id: int\n    description: str\n    required_information: str\n    expected_outcome: str\n    is_completed: bool = False\n\n\nCreate a ExecutionPlan Pydantic model:\n\nGenerated python\nclass ExecutionPlan(BaseModel):\n    original_task: str\n    steps: List[PlanStep]\n    current_step: int = 0\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\ncontent_copy\ndownload\nUse code with caution.\nPython\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\n\nModify AgentResponse to optionally include the ExecutionPlan.\n\nAgent Role and Prompt Engineering:\n\nPlanner Agent: Define a new AgentRole enum value, PLANNER. The system prompt for this agent must be:\n\n\"You are a master strategist and planner. Your task is to receive a complex user request and decompose it into a structured, sequential list of logical steps. For each step, clearly define the action to be taken and what specific information is required to complete it. Output this plan as a JSON object adhering to the ExecutionPlan schema. Do not attempt to solve the task, only plan it.\"\n\nResource Assessment Prompt: During the execution loop, the agent will use a sub-prompt for the necessity check:\n\n\"Current Plan Step: '{step.description}'. Information Needed: '{step.required_information}'. Reviewing the conversation history and my internal knowledge, is it absolutely necessary to use an external tool to acquire this information? Answer with only 'true' or 'false' followed by a brief justification.\"\n\nModification of ReactAgent.execute:\n\nThe method will first check if spree_mode is enabled.\n\nIf true, it will first call the PLANNER to generate the ExecutionPlan.\n\nThe main for loop will now iterate through plan.steps instead of range(self.config.max_iterations).\n\nInside the loop, it will perform the Resource Assessment step. The agent's decision to use a tool will be based on the boolean output of this self-correction step.\n\n3. Scientific Testing and Validation Protocol:\n\nThe primary hypothesis is that the SPRE-enabled agent will achieve a task success rate comparable to or higher than a pure Pre-Act agent, while significantly reducing the number of external tool calls and thus improving efficiency.\n\nBenchmark: Utilize the GAIA benchmark from the WebDancer paper (arXiv:2505.22648v1), focusing on a subset of tasks that require 3+ steps of information retrieval and reasoning.\n\nBaselines for Rigorous Comparison:\n\nVanilla ReAct: The standard LlamaAgent implementation.\n\nPre-Act Only: A modified agent that generates a plan but executes a tool for every step without resource assessment.\n\nSEM Only: A reactive agent without a plan that performs a resource assessment check before every potential tool use.\n\nSPRE Agent: The fully implemented new feature.\n\nMetrics to Collect:\n\nTask Success Rate (%): The primary measure of effectiveness.\n\nAverage Tool-API Calls per Task: The primary measure of efficiency.\n\nAverage Latency per Task (s): To measure overall task completion time.\n\nAverage Reasoning Tokens per Task: To measure cognitive overhead.\n\nResults Presentation: The findings will be presented in a clear summary table. The expected outcome is for the SPRE Agent row to show the highest (Success Rate / API Calls) ratio, scientifically demonstrating its superior strategic efficiency.\n\nAgent Configuration\tTask Success Rate (%)\tAvg. API Calls\tAvg. Latency (s)\nVanilla ReAct\t(result)\t(result)\t(result)\nPre-Act Only\t(result)\t(result)\t(result)\nSEM Only\t(result)\t(result)\t(result)\nSPRE Agent (Ours)\t(expected best)\t(expected lowest)\t(result)\n\n4. Documentation and CLI Integration:\n\nCLI Flag: Add a --spree flag to the llamaagent interactive and llamaagent chat commands. When this flag is present, the system should instantiate and use the SPRE-enabled agent logic.\n\nDocumentation:\n\nUpdate README.md to list \"Strategic Planning & Resourceful Execution (SPRE)\" as a key feature.\n\nAdd a new section under \"Advanced Usage\" explaining the SPRE methodology and how to use the --spree flag.\n\nExample Script: Create a new example file, examples/spree_usage.py, that demonstrates how to programmatically invoke the SPRE agent on a complex task, print the generated plan, and show the step-by-step execution including the resource assessment decisions.\n\n",

I will now proceed with the complete master coding prompt and scientific implementation plan for the second proposed feature: Generative Debate Tree for Data Augmentation (GDT-DA).\n\nThis prompt builds on the scientific foundation of the MASTER and MCTS-SQL papers, outlining a comprehensive methodology for creating a novel and powerful data generation pipeline within the LlamaAgent framework.\n\nMaster Coding Prompt: Implementing Generative Debate Tree for Data Augmentation (GDT-DA)\n\nObjective:\nArchitect a novel, automated data generation framework, GDT-DA, designed to produce a superior corpus of training data for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. This framework will leverage a multi-agent system to simulate a structured, exploratory debate around a given problem, generating rich, multi-perspective reasoning traces. Inspired by the \"simulated teaching\" in the MASTER paper and the exploratory search from MCTS-SQL, the goal is to create a dataset that teaches models not just what the right answer is, but how to reason towards it by exploring arguments, identifying flaws, and synthesizing information, thereby producing models with demonstrably stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks.\n\n1. GDT-DA Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe GDT-DA pipeline will be an offline process that takes a dataset of problems (e.g., math questions) and outputs a new, augmented dataset of detailed reasoning traces. The process for each problem is as follows:\n\nProblem Initialization: A seed problem (e.g., a question from the GSM8K dataset) is used to initialize the root DebateNode of a new tree.\n\nTree Expansion - Multi-Agent Debate:\n\nArgument Generation (Expansion): For the current active node, multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer) are prompted in parallel to propose the next logical step, argument, or piece of evidence. Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path.

This framework will leverage a multi-agent system to simulate a structured, exploratory debate around a given problem, generating rich, multi-perspective reasoning traces. Inspired by the \"simulated teaching\" in the MASTER paper and the exploratory search from MCTS-SQL, the goal is to create a dataset that teaches models not just what the right answer is, but how to reason towards it by exploring arguments, identifying flaws, and synthesizing information, thereby producing models with demonstrably stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks.\n\n1. GDT-DA Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe GDT-DA pipeline will be an offline process that takes a dataset of problems (e.g., math questions) and outputs a new, augmented dataset of detailed reasoning traces. The process for each problem is as follows:\n\nProblem Initialization: A seed problem (e.g., a question from the GSM8K dataset) is used to initialize the root DebateNode of a new tree.\n\nTree Expansion - Multi-Agent Debate:\n\nArgument Generation (Expansion): For the current active node, multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer) are prompted in parallel to propose the next logical step, argument, or piece of evidence. Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path. This path, including the initial problem, all intermediate agent arguments, and the corresponding critiques, is concatenated into a single, structured conversational document.

This framework will leverage a multi-agent system to simulate a structured, exploratory debate around a given problem, generating rich, multi-perspective reasoning traces. Inspired by the \"simulated teaching\" in the MASTER paper and the exploratory search from MCTS-SQL, the goal is to create a dataset that teaches models not just what the right answer is, but how to reason towards it by exploring arguments, identifying flaws, and synthesizing information, thereby producing models with demonstrably stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks.\n\n1. GDT-DA Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe GDT-DA pipeline will be an offline process that takes a dataset of problems (e.g., math questions) and outputs a new, augmented dataset of detailed reasoning traces. The process for each problem is as follows:\n\nProblem Initialization: A seed problem (e.g., a question from the GSM8K dataset) is used to initialize the root DebateNode of a new tree.\n\nTree Expansion - Multi-Agent Debate:\n\nArgument Generation (Expansion): For the current active node, multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer) are prompted in parallel to propose the next logical step, argument, or piece of evidence. Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path. This path, including the initial problem, all intermediate agent arguments, and the corresponding critiques, is concatenated into a single, structured conversational document.

This framework will leverage a multi-agent system to simulate a structured, exploratory debate around a given problem, generating rich, multi-perspective reasoning traces. Inspired by the \"simulated teaching\" in the MASTER paper and the exploratory search from MCTS-SQL, the goal is to create a dataset that teaches models not just what the right answer is, but how to reason towards it by exploring arguments, identifying flaws, and synthesizing information, thereby producing models with demonstrably stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks.\n\n1. GDT-DA Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe GDT-DA pipeline will be an offline process that takes a dataset of problems (e.g., math questions) and outputs a new, augmented dataset of detailed reasoning traces. The process for each problem is as follows:\n\nProblem Initialization: A seed problem (e.g., a question from the GSM8K dataset) is used to initialize the root DebateNode of a new tree.\n\nTree Expansion - Multi-Agent Debate:\n\nArgument Generation (Expansion): For the current active node, multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer) are prompted in parallel to propose the next logical step, argument, or piece of evidence. Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path. This path, including the initial problem, all intermediate agent arguments, and the corresponding critiques, is concatenated into a single, structured conversational document.

This framework will leverage a multi-agent system to simulate a structured, exploratory debate around a given problem, generating rich, multi-perspective reasoning traces. Inspired by the \"simulated teaching\" in the MASTER paper and the exploratory search from MCTS-SQL, the goal is to create a dataset that teaches models not just what the right answer is, but how to reason towards it by exploring arguments, identifying flaws, and synthesizing information, thereby producing models with demonstrably stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks.\n\n1. GDT-DA Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe GDT-DA pipeline will be an offline process that takes a dataset of problems (e.g., math questions) and outputs a new, augmented dataset of detailed reasoning traces. The process for each problem is as follows:\n\nProblem Initialization: A seed problem (e.g., a question from the GSM8K dataset) is used to initialize the root DebateNode of a new tree.\n\nTree Expansion - Multi-Agent Debate:\n\nArgument Generation (Expansion): For the current active node, multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer) are prompted in parallel to propose the next logical step, argument, or piece of evidence. Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path.

    "technique": "SPRE",
    "task": "Excellent. I will now proceed with the complete master coding prompt and scientific implementation plan for the first and most foundational feature we designed: Strategic Planning & Resourceful Execution (SPRE).\n\nThis prompt is engineered to be a comprehensive, production-ready directive. It integrates the core concepts from the \"Pre-Act\" paper (for multi-step planning) and the \"SEM\" paper (for resource-efficient tool use), providing a clear path from theory to implementation within the LlamaAgent framework.\n\nMaster Coding Prompt: Implementing Strategic Planning & Resourceful Execution (SPRE)\n\nObjective:\nIntegrate a two-tiered reasoning framework, SPRE, into the LlamaAgent core to fundamentally enhance its decision-making capabilities. The primary goal is to evolve the agent from a purely reactive system to a strategic planner that not only formulates a multi-step plan to solve a task but also judiciously assesses the necessity of each tool-based action to conserve resources. This will be accomplished by introducing an explicit \"Planning Phase\" before the execution loop and embedding a \"Resource Assessment\" check within the loop, directly inspired by the methodologies outlined in the Pre-Act and SEM research papers.\n\n1. SPRE Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe existing ReactAgent execution flow will be modified to follow this new, more sophisticated SPRE cycle:\n\nTask Ingestion: The agent receives the user's prompt.\n\nPlanning Phase (Pre-Act Inspired):\n\nA specialized Planner agent is invoked.\n\nIt receives the user's full task description.\n\nIt generates and outputs a structured, multi-step execution plan as a list of PlanStep objects. Each step will contain a description and required_information.\n\nIterative Execution Loop: The agent iterates through the PlanStep objects. For each step:\n\nResource Assessment (SEM Inspired): The agent first performs an internal \"necessity check.\" It asks itself: \"Given my current context, history, and internal knowledge, is invoking an external tool strictly necessary to acquire the required_information for this step?\"\n\nDecision Fork:\n\nIf Tool is Necessary: The agent proceeds with the standard ReAct tool invocation (Thought -> Action -> Observation).\n\nIf Tool is NOT Necessary: The agent skips the tool call and instead generates a Thought that explains how it can fulfill the step using its existing knowledge. It then proceeds to the next plan step.\n\nSynthesis and Final Answer: After completing all plan steps (or determining it can conclude early), a Synthesizer agent aggregates all observations and internal reasoning steps to produce the final, comprehensive answer.\n\n2. Component-Level Implementation Plan:\n\nFile Modifications:\n\nPrimary modifications will occur in src/llamaagent/agents/react.py.\n\nSupporting data classes will be added in src/llamaagent/agents/base.py.\n\nCLI flag integration in src/llamaagent/cli/main.py.\n\nNew Data Structures (src/llamaagent/agents/base.py):\n\nCreate a PlanStep Pydantic model:\n\nGenerated python\nclass PlanStep(BaseModel):\n    step_id: int\n    description: str\n    required_information: str\n    expected_outcome: str\n    is_completed: bool = False\n\n\nCreate a ExecutionPlan Pydantic model:\n\nGenerated python\nclass ExecutionPlan(BaseModel):\n    original_task: str\n    steps: List[PlanStep]\n    current_step: int = 0\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\ncontent_copy\ndownload\nUse code with caution.\nPython\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\n\nModify AgentResponse to optionally include the ExecutionPlan.\n\nAgent Role and Prompt Engineering:\n\nPlanner Agent: Define a new AgentRole enum value, PLANNER. The system prompt for this agent must be:\n\n\"You are a master strategist and planner. Your task is to receive a complex user request and decompose it into a structured, sequential list of logical steps. For each step, clearly define the action to be taken and what specific information is required to complete it. Output this plan as a JSON object adhering to the ExecutionPlan schema. Do not attempt to solve the task, only plan it.\"\n\nResource Assessment Prompt: During the execution loop, the agent will use a sub-prompt for the necessity check:\n\n\"Current Plan Step: '{step.description}'. Information Needed: '{step.required_information}'. Reviewing the conversation history and my internal knowledge, is it absolutely necessary to use an external tool to acquire this information? Answer with only 'true' or 'false' followed by a brief justification.\"\n\nModification of ReactAgent.execute:\n\nThe method will first check if spree_mode is enabled.\n\nIf true, it will first call the PLANNER to generate the ExecutionPlan.\n\nThe main for loop will now iterate through plan.steps instead of range(self.config.max_iterations).\n\nInside the loop, it will perform the Resource Assessment step. The agent's decision to use a tool will be based on the boolean output of this self-correction step.\n\n3. Scientific Testing and Validation Protocol:\n\nThe primary hypothesis is that the SPRE-enabled agent will achieve a task success rate comparable to or higher than a pure Pre-Act agent, while significantly reducing the number of external tool calls and thus improving efficiency.\n\nBenchmark: Utilize the GAIA benchmark from the WebDancer paper (arXiv:2505.22648v1), focusing on a subset of tasks that require 3+ steps of information retrieval and reasoning.\n\nBaselines for Rigorous Comparison:\n\nVanilla ReAct: The standard LlamaAgent implementation.\n\nPre-Act Only: A modified agent that generates a plan but executes a tool for every step without resource assessment.\n\nSEM Only: A reactive agent without a plan that performs a resource assessment check before every potential tool use.\n\nSPRE Agent: The fully implemented new feature.\n\nMetrics to Collect:\n\nTask Success Rate (%): The primary measure of effectiveness.\n\nAverage Tool-API Calls per Task: The primary measure of efficiency.\n\nAverage Latency per Task (s): To measure overall task completion time.\n\nAverage Reasoning Tokens per Task: To measure cognitive overhead.\n\nResults Presentation: The findings will be presented in a clear summary table. The expected outcome is for the SPRE Agent row to show the highest (Success Rate / API Calls) ratio, scientifically demonstrating its superior strategic efficiency.\n\nAgent Configuration\tTask Success Rate (%)\tAvg. API Calls\tAvg. Latency (s)\nVanilla ReAct\t(result)\t(result)\t(result)\nPre-Act Only\t(result)\t(result)\t(result)\nSEM Only\t(result)\t(result)\t(result)\nSPRE Agent (Ours)\t(expected best)\t(expected lowest)\t(result)\n\n4. Documentation and CLI Integration:\n\nCLI Flag: Add a --spree flag to the llamaagent interactive and llamaagent chat commands. When this flag is present, the system should instantiate and use the SPRE-enabled agent logic.\n\nDocumentation:\n\nUpdate README.md to list \"Strategic Planning & Resourceful Execution (SPRE)\" as a key feature.\n\nAdd a new section under \"Advanced Usage\" explaining the SPRE methodology and how to use the --spree flag.\n\nExample Script: Create a new example file, examples/spree_usage.py, that demonstrates how to programmatically invoke the SPRE agent on a complex task, print the generated plan, and show the step-by-step execution including the resource assessment decisions.\n\n",

Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path.

This framework will leverage a multi-agent system to simulate a structured, exploratory debate around a given problem, generating rich, multi-perspective reasoning traces. Inspired by the \"simulated teaching\" in the MASTER paper and the exploratory search from MCTS-SQL, the goal is to create a dataset that teaches models not just what the right answer is, but how to reason towards it by exploring arguments, identifying flaws, and synthesizing information, thereby producing models with demonstrably stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks.\n\n1. GDT-DA Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe GDT-DA pipeline will be an offline process that takes a dataset of problems (e.g., math questions) and outputs a new, augmented dataset of detailed reasoning traces. The process for each problem is as follows:\n\nProblem Initialization: A seed problem (e.g., a question from the GSM8K dataset) is used to initialize the root DebateNode of a new tree.\n\nTree Expansion - Multi-Agent Debate:\n\nArgument Generation (Expansion): For the current active node, multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer) are prompted in parallel to propose the next logical step, argument, or piece of evidence. Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path.

Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path.

Inspired by the \"simulated teaching\" in the MASTER paper and the exploratory search from MCTS-SQL, the goal is to create a dataset that teaches models not just what the right answer is, but how to reason towards it by exploring arguments, identifying flaws, and synthesizing information, thereby producing models with demonstrably stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks.\n\n1. GDT-DA Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe GDT-DA pipeline will be an offline process that takes a dataset of problems (e.g., math questions) and outputs a new, augmented dataset of detailed reasoning traces. The process for each problem is as follows:\n\nProblem Initialization: A seed problem (e.g., a question from the GSM8K dataset) is used to initialize the root DebateNode of a new tree.\n\nTree Expansion - Multi-Agent Debate:\n\nArgument Generation (Expansion): For the current active node, multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer) are prompted in parallel to propose the next logical step, argument, or piece of evidence. Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path.

This framework will leverage a multi-agent system to simulate a structured, exploratory debate around a given problem, generating rich, multi-perspective reasoning traces. Inspired by the \"simulated teaching\" in the MASTER paper and the exploratory search from MCTS-SQL, the goal is to create a dataset that teaches models not just what the right answer is, but how to reason towards it by exploring arguments, identifying flaws, and synthesizing information, thereby producing models with demonstrably stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks.\n\n1. GDT-DA Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe GDT-DA pipeline will be an offline process that takes a dataset of problems (e.g., math questions) and outputs a new, augmented dataset of detailed reasoning traces. The process for each problem is as follows:\n\nProblem Initialization: A seed problem (e.g., a question from the GSM8K dataset) is used to initialize the root DebateNode of a new tree.\n\nTree Expansion - Multi-Agent Debate:\n\nArgument Generation (Expansion): For the current active node, multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer) are prompted in parallel to propose the next logical step, argument, or piece of evidence. Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path. This path, including the initial problem, all intermediate agent arguments, and the corresponding critiques, is concatenated into a single, structured conversational document.

Inspired by the \"simulated teaching\" in the MASTER paper and the exploratory search from MCTS-SQL, the goal is to create a dataset that teaches models not just what the right answer is, but how to reason towards it by exploring arguments, identifying flaws, and synthesizing information, thereby producing models with demonstrably stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks.\n\n1. GDT-DA Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe GDT-DA pipeline will be an offline process that takes a dataset of problems (e.g., math questions) and outputs a new, augmented dataset of detailed reasoning traces. The process for each problem is as follows:\n\nProblem Initialization: A seed problem (e.g., a question from the GSM8K dataset) is used to initialize the root DebateNode of a new tree.\n\nTree Expansion - Multi-Agent Debate:\n\nArgument Generation (Expansion): For the current active node, multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer) are prompted in parallel to propose the next logical step, argument, or piece of evidence. Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path.

    "technique": "SPRE",
    "task": "Excellent. I will now proceed with the complete master coding prompt and scientific implementation plan for the first and most foundational feature we designed: Strategic Planning & Resourceful Execution (SPRE).\n\nThis prompt is engineered to be a comprehensive, production-ready directive. It integrates the core concepts from the \"Pre-Act\" paper (for multi-step planning) and the \"SEM\" paper (for resource-efficient tool use), providing a clear path from theory to implementation within the LlamaAgent framework.\n\nMaster Coding Prompt: Implementing Strategic Planning & Resourceful Execution (SPRE)\n\nObjective:\nIntegrate a two-tiered reasoning framework, SPRE, into the LlamaAgent core to fundamentally enhance its decision-making capabilities. The primary goal is to evolve the agent from a purely reactive system to a strategic planner that not only formulates a multi-step plan to solve a task but also judiciously assesses the necessity of each tool-based action to conserve resources. This will be accomplished by introducing an explicit \"Planning Phase\" before the execution loop and embedding a \"Resource Assessment\" check within the loop, directly inspired by the methodologies outlined in the Pre-Act and SEM research papers.\n\n1. SPRE Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe existing ReactAgent execution flow will be modified to follow this new, more sophisticated SPRE cycle:\n\nTask Ingestion: The agent receives the user's prompt.\n\nPlanning Phase (Pre-Act Inspired):\n\nA specialized Planner agent is invoked.\n\nIt receives the user's full task description.\n\nIt generates and outputs a structured, multi-step execution plan as a list of PlanStep objects. Each step will contain a description and required_information.\n\nIterative Execution Loop: The agent iterates through the PlanStep objects. For each step:\n\nResource Assessment (SEM Inspired): The agent first performs an internal \"necessity check.\" It asks itself: \"Given my current context, history, and internal knowledge, is invoking an external tool strictly necessary to acquire the required_information for this step?\"\n\nDecision Fork:\n\nIf Tool is Necessary: The agent proceeds with the standard ReAct tool invocation (Thought -> Action -> Observation).\n\nIf Tool is NOT Necessary: The agent skips the tool call and instead generates a Thought that explains how it can fulfill the step using its existing knowledge. It then proceeds to the next plan step.\n\nSynthesis and Final Answer: After completing all plan steps (or determining it can conclude early), a Synthesizer agent aggregates all observations and internal reasoning steps to produce the final, comprehensive answer.\n\n2. Component-Level Implementation Plan:\n\nFile Modifications:\n\nPrimary modifications will occur in src/llamaagent/agents/react.py.\n\nSupporting data classes will be added in src/llamaagent/agents/base.py.\n\nCLI flag integration in src/llamaagent/cli/main.py.\n\nNew Data Structures (src/llamaagent/agents/base.py):\n\nCreate a PlanStep Pydantic model:\n\nGenerated python\nclass PlanStep(BaseModel):\n    step_id: int\n    description: str\n    required_information: str\n    expected_outcome: str\n    is_completed: bool = False\n\n\nCreate a ExecutionPlan Pydantic model:\n\nGenerated python\nclass ExecutionPlan(BaseModel):\n    original_task: str\n    steps: List[PlanStep]\n    current_step: int = 0\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\ncontent_copy\ndownload\nUse code with caution.\nPython\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\n\nModify AgentResponse to optionally include the ExecutionPlan.\n\nAgent Role and Prompt Engineering:\n\nPlanner Agent: Define a new AgentRole enum value, PLANNER. The system prompt for this agent must be:\n\n\"You are a master strategist and planner. Your task is to receive a complex user request and decompose it into a structured, sequential list of logical steps. For each step, clearly define the action to be taken and what specific information is required to complete it. Output this plan as a JSON object adhering to the ExecutionPlan schema. Do not attempt to solve the task, only plan it.\"\n\nResource Assessment Prompt: During the execution loop, the agent will use a sub-prompt for the necessity check:\n\n\"Current Plan Step: '{step.description}'. Information Needed: '{step.required_information}'. Reviewing the conversation history and my internal knowledge, is it absolutely necessary to use an external tool to acquire this information? Answer with only 'true' or 'false' followed by a brief justification.\"\n\nModification of ReactAgent.execute:\n\nThe method will first check if spree_mode is enabled.\n\nIf true, it will first call the PLANNER to generate the ExecutionPlan.\n\nThe main for loop will now iterate through plan.steps instead of range(self.config.max_iterations).\n\nInside the loop, it will perform the Resource Assessment step. The agent's decision to use a tool will be based on the boolean output of this self-correction step.\n\n3. Scientific Testing and Validation Protocol:\n\nThe primary hypothesis is that the SPRE-enabled agent will achieve a task success rate comparable to or higher than a pure Pre-Act agent, while significantly reducing the number of external tool calls and thus improving efficiency.\n\nBenchmark: Utilize the GAIA benchmark from the WebDancer paper (arXiv:2505.22648v1), focusing on a subset of tasks that require 3+ steps of information retrieval and reasoning.\n\nBaselines for Rigorous Comparison:\n\nVanilla ReAct: The standard LlamaAgent implementation.\n\nPre-Act Only: A modified agent that generates a plan but executes a tool for every step without resource assessment.\n\nSEM Only: A reactive agent without a plan that performs a resource assessment check before every potential tool use.\n\nSPRE Agent: The fully implemented new feature.\n\nMetrics to Collect:\n\nTask Success Rate (%): The primary measure of effectiveness.\n\nAverage Tool-API Calls per Task: The primary measure of efficiency.\n\nAverage Latency per Task (s): To measure overall task completion time.\n\nAverage Reasoning Tokens per Task: To measure cognitive overhead.\n\nResults Presentation: The findings will be presented in a clear summary table. The expected outcome is for the SPRE Agent row to show the highest (Success Rate / API Calls) ratio, scientifically demonstrating its superior strategic efficiency.\n\nAgent Configuration\tTask Success Rate (%)\tAvg. API Calls\tAvg. Latency (s)\nVanilla ReAct\t(result)\t(result)\t(result)\nPre-Act Only\t(result)\t(result)\t(result)\nSEM Only\t(result)\t(result)\t(result)\nSPRE Agent (Ours)\t(expected best)\t(expected lowest)\t(result)\n\n4. Documentation and CLI Integration:\n\nCLI Flag: Add a --spree flag to the llamaagent interactive and llamaagent chat commands. When this flag is present, the system should instantiate and use the SPRE-enabled agent logic.\n\nDocumentation:\n\nUpdate README.md to list \"Strategic Planning & Resourceful Execution (SPRE)\" as a key feature.\n\nAdd a new section under \"Advanced Usage\" explaining the SPRE methodology and how to use the --spree flag.\n\nExample Script: Create a new example file, examples/spree_usage.py, that demonstrates how to programmatically invoke the SPRE agent on a complex task, print the generated plan, and show the step-by-step execution including the resource assessment decisions.\n\n",

I will now proceed with the complete master coding prompt and scientific implementation plan for the second proposed feature: Generative Debate Tree for Data Augmentation (GDT-DA).\n\nThis prompt builds on the scientific foundation of the MASTER and MCTS-SQL papers, outlining a comprehensive methodology for creating a novel and powerful data generation pipeline within the LlamaAgent framework.\n\nMaster Coding Prompt: Implementing Generative Debate Tree for Data Augmentation (GDT-DA)\n\nObjective:\nArchitect a novel, automated data generation framework, GDT-DA, designed to produce a superior corpus of training data for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. This framework will leverage a multi-agent system to simulate a structured, exploratory debate around a given problem, generating rich, multi-perspective reasoning traces. Inspired by the \"simulated teaching\" in the MASTER paper and the exploratory search from MCTS-SQL, the goal is to create a dataset that teaches models not just what the right answer is, but how to reason towards it by exploring arguments, identifying flaws, and synthesizing information, thereby producing models with demonstrably stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks.\n\n1. GDT-DA Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe GDT-DA pipeline will be an offline process that takes a dataset of problems (e.g., math questions) and outputs a new, augmented dataset of detailed reasoning traces. The process for each problem is as follows:\n\nProblem Initialization: A seed problem (e.g., a question from the GSM8K dataset) is used to initialize the root DebateNode of a new tree.\n\nTree Expansion - Multi-Agent Debate:\n\nArgument Generation (Expansion): For the current active node, multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer) are prompted in parallel to propose the next logical step, argument, or piece of evidence. Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path. This path, including the initial problem, all intermediate agent arguments, and the corresponding critiques, is concatenated into a single, structured conversational document. This document becomes one entry in the new fine-tuning dataset.\n\n2. Component-Level Implementation Plan:\n\nNew Directory Structure: This is a new, major capability.

Analyze the following proposal in the context of the overall problem. Assess its factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance. Assign a score from 0.0 to 1.0 and provide a justification. Identify any fallacies or errors.\"\n\n3. Scientific Testing and Validation Protocol:\n\nThe core hypothesis is that fine-tuning a model on the rich, debate-style traces from GDT-DA leads to superior reasoning performance compared to fine-tuning on standard question-answer pairs or simple CoT traces.\n\nBenchmark: The GSM8K dataset is ideal due to its focus on complex, multi-step mathematical reasoning.\n\nData Generation:\n\nUse the GDT-DA pipeline on the official GSM8K training split to generate a new, augmented training set: GSM8K-GDT.

This framework will leverage a multi-agent system to simulate a structured, exploratory debate around a given problem, generating rich, multi-perspective reasoning traces. Inspired by the \"simulated teaching\" in the MASTER paper and the exploratory search from MCTS-SQL, the goal is to create a dataset that teaches models not just what the right answer is, but how to reason towards it by exploring arguments, identifying flaws, and synthesizing information, thereby producing models with demonstrably stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks.\n\n1. GDT-DA Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe GDT-DA pipeline will be an offline process that takes a dataset of problems (e.g., math questions) and outputs a new, augmented dataset of detailed reasoning traces. The process for each problem is as follows:\n\nProblem Initialization: A seed problem (e.g., a question from the GSM8K dataset) is used to initialize the root DebateNode of a new tree.\n\nTree Expansion - Multi-Agent Debate:\n\nArgument Generation (Expansion): For the current active node, multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer) are prompted in parallel to propose the next logical step, argument, or piece of evidence. Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path. This path, including the initial problem, all intermediate agent arguments, and the corresponding critiques, is concatenated into a single, structured conversational document.

This framework will leverage a multi-agent system to simulate a structured, exploratory debate around a given problem, generating rich, multi-perspective reasoning traces. Inspired by the \"simulated teaching\" in the MASTER paper and the exploratory search from MCTS-SQL, the goal is to create a dataset that teaches models not just what the right answer is, but how to reason towards it by exploring arguments, identifying flaws, and synthesizing information, thereby producing models with demonstrably stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks.\n\n1. GDT-DA Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe GDT-DA pipeline will be an offline process that takes a dataset of problems (e.g., math questions) and outputs a new, augmented dataset of detailed reasoning traces. The process for each problem is as follows:\n\nProblem Initialization: A seed problem (e.g., a question from the GSM8K dataset) is used to initialize the root DebateNode of a new tree.\n\nTree Expansion - Multi-Agent Debate:\n\nArgument Generation (Expansion): For the current active node, multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer) are prompted in parallel to propose the next logical step, argument, or piece of evidence. Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path. This path, including the initial problem, all intermediate agent arguments, and the corresponding critiques, is concatenated into a single, structured conversational document.

This framework will leverage a multi-agent system to simulate a structured, exploratory debate around a given problem, generating rich, multi-perspective reasoning traces. Inspired by the \"simulated teaching\" in the MASTER paper and the exploratory search from MCTS-SQL, the goal is to create a dataset that teaches models not just what the right answer is, but how to reason towards it by exploring arguments, identifying flaws, and synthesizing information, thereby producing models with demonstrably stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks.\n\n1. GDT-DA Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe GDT-DA pipeline will be an offline process that takes a dataset of problems (e.g., math questions) and outputs a new, augmented dataset of detailed reasoning traces. The process for each problem is as follows:\n\nProblem Initialization: A seed problem (e.g., a question from the GSM8K dataset) is used to initialize the root DebateNode of a new tree.\n\nTree Expansion - Multi-Agent Debate:\n\nArgument Generation (Expansion): For the current active node, multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer) are prompted in parallel to propose the next logical step, argument, or piece of evidence. Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path. This path, including the initial problem, all intermediate agent arguments, and the corresponding critiques, is concatenated into a single, structured conversational document. This document becomes one entry in the new fine-tuning dataset.\n\n2. Component-Level Implementation Plan:\n\nNew Directory Structure: This is a new, major capability.

Analyze the following proposal in the context of the overall problem. Assess its factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance. Assign a score from 0.0 to 1.0 and provide a justification. Identify any fallacies or errors.\"\n\n3. Scientific Testing and Validation Protocol:\n\nThe core hypothesis is that fine-tuning a model on the rich, debate-style traces from GDT-DA leads to superior reasoning performance compared to fine-tuning on standard question-answer pairs or simple CoT traces.\n\nBenchmark: The GSM8K dataset is ideal due to its focus on complex, multi-step mathematical reasoning.\n\nData Generation:\n\nUse the GDT-DA pipeline on the official GSM8K training split to generate a new, augmented training set: GSM8K-GDT.

This framework will leverage a multi-agent system to simulate a structured, exploratory debate around a given problem, generating rich, multi-perspective reasoning traces. Inspired by the \"simulated teaching\" in the MASTER paper and the exploratory search from MCTS-SQL, the goal is to create a dataset that teaches models not just what the right answer is, but how to reason towards it by exploring arguments, identifying flaws, and synthesizing information, thereby producing models with demonstrably stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks.\n\n1. GDT-DA Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe GDT-DA pipeline will be an offline process that takes a dataset of problems (e.g., math questions) and outputs a new, augmented dataset of detailed reasoning traces. The process for each problem is as follows:\n\nProblem Initialization: A seed problem (e.g., a question from the GSM8K dataset) is used to initialize the root DebateNode of a new tree.\n\nTree Expansion - Multi-Agent Debate:\n\nArgument Generation (Expansion): For the current active node, multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer) are prompted in parallel to propose the next logical step, argument, or piece of evidence. Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path. This path, including the initial problem, all intermediate agent arguments, and the corresponding critiques, is concatenated into a single, structured conversational document. This document becomes one entry in the new fine-tuning dataset.\n\n2. Component-Level Implementation Plan:\n\nNew Directory Structure: This is a new, major capability.

Given the current argument, find a verifiable piece of external information that either supports or refutes it. Provide a clear, factual statement.\n\nContext: Problem: Of course. I will now proceed with the complete master coding prompt and scientific implementation plan for the second proposed feature: Generative Debate Tree for Data Augmentation (GDT-DA).\n\nThis prompt builds on the scientific foundation of the MASTER and MCTS-SQL papers, outlining a comprehensive methodology for creating a novel and powerful data generation pipeline within the LlamaAgent framework.\n\nMaster Coding Prompt: Implementing Generative Debate Tree for Data Augmentation (GDT-DA)\n\nObjective:\nArchitect a novel, automated data generation framework, GDT-DA, designed to produce a superior corpus of training data for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. This framework will leverage a multi-agent system to simulate a structured, exploratory debate around a given problem, generating rich, multi-perspective reasoning traces. Inspired by the \"simulated teaching\" in the MASTER paper and the exploratory search from MCTS-SQL, the goal is to create a dataset that teaches models not just what the right answer is, but how to reason towards it by exploring arguments, identifying flaws, and synthesizing information, thereby producing models with demonstrably stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks.\n\n1. GDT-DA Core Logic & Execution Flow:\n\nThe GDT-DA pipeline will be an offline process that takes a dataset of problems (e.g., math questions) and outputs a new, augmented dataset of detailed reasoning traces. The process for each problem is as follows:\n\nProblem Initialization: A seed problem (e.g., a question from the GSM8K dataset) is used to initialize the root DebateNode of a new tree.\n\nTree Expansion - Multi-Agent Debate:\n\nArgument Generation (Expansion): For the current active node, multiple specialized agents (Researcher, Analyzer) are prompted in parallel to propose the next logical step, argument, or piece of evidence. Each unique proposal creates a new child DebateNode in the tree.\n\nCritique and Evaluation (Simulation): A Critic agent is invoked to evaluate each new child node. It assesses the proposal for factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance to the overall problem. The Critic assigns a quality score and provides a textual justification for its assessment.\n\nPath Selection (Selection): The GDTOrchestrator selects the most promising node (the one with the highest score from the Critic) as the active node for the next round of expansion.\n\nTermination and Trace Extraction: The process repeats until a DebateNode contains a final, validated answer and is marked as a terminal state.\n\nTrace Compilation (Backpropagation): The system backtracks from the successful terminal node to the root, capturing the entire \"winning\" path. This path, including the initial problem, all intermediate agent arguments, and the corresponding critiques, is concatenated into a single, structured conversational document. This document becomes one entry in the new fine-tuning dataset.\n\n2. Component-Level Implementation Plan:\n\nNew Directory Structure: This is a new, major capability. Create a dedicated directory: src/llamaagent/data_generation/.\n\ngdt.py: Contains the main GDTOrchestrator class.\n\nbase.py: Will house new Pydantic data models for the debate process.\n\nNew Data Structures (src/llamaagent/data_generation/base.py):\n\nCreate a DebateNode class:\n\nGenerated python\nclass DebateNode(BaseModel):\n    node_id: str = Field(default_factory=lambda: str(uuid.uuid4()))\n    parent_id: Optional[str]\n    proposal: str  # The reasoning step or argument\n    proposing_agent_role: AgentRole\n    critique: str = \"\"\n    score: float = 0.0\n    is_terminal: bool = False\n\n\nCreate a DebateTrace class for the final output format:\n\nGenerated python\nclass DebateTrace(BaseModel):\n    original_problem: str\n    final_answer: str\n    full_debate_transcript: List[Dict[str, str]] # Formatted for ShareGPT\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\ncontent_copy\ndownload\nUse code with caution.\nPython\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\n\nGDTOrchestrator Module (src/llamaagent/data_generation/gdt.py):\n\nThis class will manage the entire data generation process.\n\nIt will hold the state of the DebateTree (implemented as a dictionary mapping node_id to DebateNode).\n\nIt will instantiate a MultiAgent system with Researcher, Analyzer, and Critic agents.\n\nIt will manage the turn-taking logic of the debate, passing context to the agents and parsing their responses to create and score new nodes.\n\nIt will implement the logic for selecting the next node to expand based on the Critic's score.\n\nAgent Role and Prompt Engineering: The debate context requires tailored prompts:\n\nResearcher Prompt: \"Given the current argument, find a verifiable piece of external information that either supports or refutes it.\"\n\nAnalyzer Prompt: \"Given the current argument, propose the next logical deduction or mathematical step required to advance the problem-solving process.\"\n\nCritic Prompt: \"You are a logical reasoner. Analyze the following proposal in the context of the overall problem. Assess its factual accuracy, logical soundness, and relevance. Assign a score from 0.0 to 1.0 and provide a justification. Identify any fallacies or errors.\"\n\n3. Scientific Testing and Validation Protocol:\n\nThe core hypothesis is that fine-tuning a model on the rich, debate-style traces from GDT-DA leads to superior reasoning performance compared to fine-tuning on standard question-answer pairs or simple CoT traces.\n\nBenchmark: The GSM8K dataset is ideal due to its focus on complex, multi-step mathematical reasoning.\n\nData Generation:\n\nUse the GDT-DA pipeline on the official GSM8K training split to generate a new, augmented training set: GSM8K-GDT.
