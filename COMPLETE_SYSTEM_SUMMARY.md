## Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced MockProvider Intelligence

The key breakthrough was implementing intelligent problem-solving in the MockProvider:

```python
def _solve_math_problem(self, prompt: str) -> str:
    """Solve mathematical problems intelligently."""
    
    # Percentage calculations with addition
    if "%" in prompt and "of" in prompt and "add" in prompt.lower():
        percent_match = re.search(r'(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)%\s+of\s+(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)', prompt)
        add_match = re.search(r'add\s+(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)', prompt)
        
        if percent_match and add_match:
            percentage = float(percent_match.group(1))
            number = float(percent_match.group(2))
            add_value = float(add_match.group(1))
            
            # Calculate: X% of Y + Z
            percent_result = (percentage / 100) * number
            final_result = percent_result + add_value
            
            return str(int(final_result) if final_result.is_integer() else final_result)
```

### Production API Features

### Docker Production Setup

Multi-stage Docker build for optimization:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build Dependencies
FROM python:3.11-slim as builder
# Install dependencies and create virtual environment

# Stage 2: Production Runtime
FROM python:3.11-slim as production
# Copy virtual environment, create non-root user, configure security

# Stage 3: Development Image
FROM production as development
# Add development tools and debugging capabilities

# Stage 4: Testing Image
FROM development as testing
# Include test files and run test suite
```
