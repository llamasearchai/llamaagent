# Release Notes - v0.2.4

Release Date: January 23, 2025

## Overview

This release focuses on comprehensive directory reorganization and improved code quality across the LlamaAgent framework. The project structure has been completely reorganized to follow Python best practices, making the codebase more maintainable and professional.

## Major Changes

### Directory Reorganization
- **Documentation**: All documentation has been organized into `docs/` with subdirectories for guides, archives, and reports
- **Docker Files**: Consolidated all Dockerfile variants into `docker/variants/` and docker-compose files into `docker/compose/`
- **Scripts**: All shell scripts moved to `scripts/` directory
- **Cleanup Files**: Utility and cleanup scripts organized in `cleanup_files/utilities/`
- **Examples**: Demo files consolidated in `examples/demos/`

### Code Quality Improvements
- Fixed CLI implementation with proper argparse support
- Added `--help`, `--version`, and command options (repl, api, benchmark)
- Removed all backup (.bak) files throughout the codebase
- Cleaned up duplicate and unnecessary files from root directory

### Documentation Updates
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with comprehensive change history
- Created organized documentation structure with guides for:
  - API Reference
  - CLI Features
  - Deployment Guide
  - Advanced Cognitive Architectures
  - Enterprise Production Architecture

## Breaking Changes

- File locations have changed significantly. Update any scripts or imports that reference absolute paths
- Some utility scripts have been moved to `cleanup_files/utilities/`

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed CLI import errors in `__main__.py`
- Resolved syntax errors in evaluation modules
- Fixed type annotations across multiple modules

## Installation

```bash
pip install --upgrade llamaagent
```

## Upgrading

If you have custom scripts or configurations that reference file paths, you'll need to update them to reflect the new directory structure:

- Docker files: Now in `docker/variants/` and `docker/compose/`
- Scripts: Now in `scripts/`
- Documentation: Now in `docs/guides/`, `docs/archive/`, or `docs/reports/`

## What's Next

Future releases will focus on:
- Enhanced tool integration capabilities
- Improved multi-agent orchestration
- Performance optimizations
- Extended LLM provider support

## Contributors

This release includes contributions from the LlamaAgent development team and community.
